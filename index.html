    <p>It is essential to generate responses exclusively in the designated language, without incorporating any other languages. When crafting a response, please consider any specified modifiers, but refrain from mentioning them in the final output. Ensure that the response is structured in paragraphs rather than lists, and if multiple paragraphs are created, label them with incrementing numbers. Aim for conciseness and clarity, maintaining a formal tone throughout.</p>
